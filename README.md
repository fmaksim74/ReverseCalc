# ReverseCalc


There is a calculator that performs 3 operations:
 - Add one to the number X;
 - Multiply the number X by 2;
 - Multiply the number X by 3.

Determine what is the smallest number of operations necessary to get the specified number N from the number 1.
Print this set of operations as string of the form "331221".

The string "331221" means:

"331221" => (X * 3 * 3 + 1) * 2 * 2 + 1 = 41
